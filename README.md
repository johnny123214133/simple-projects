# simple-projects

This is a collection of simple projects compiled for my application to WipeOS.

To see the projects in action, clone the repository.


For the Neural Style Transfer project, I highly recommend opening the notebook in Google Colab. Execute all cells. You will be prompted to provide two images for the project to use. I've provided a few in the sourceImages directory already.

For the Williams Fractal Trading Algorithm, ensure you have installed all the packages and then run the notebook. I've provided the dataset in data.zip which the notebook will unzip, extract, and use automatically.

For the Charity Website project, you can find the website up on http://164.92.67.232/ until the DNS updates with my domain name. Then it should be found on charity.zachrichards.dev or just zachrichards.dev
